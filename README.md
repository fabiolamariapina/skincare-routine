# Skincare Routine

What is it?
Skincare Routine is a skincare routine organizer. The user can see their routine, add and delete items to their routine, and edit the exisiting items in their routine. One of my stretch goals for this app is for the user to have a profile with their friends and all of their information that can impact the condition of their skin.

Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB to store the products that are added to the user's routine page
- CURL to test routes before creating the front end
- React
- React Router
- Prime React (for buttons and dropdowns)
- Bootstrap React (for forms)

Features

- Multi-page application using react router
